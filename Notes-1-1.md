# What is Infrastructure as Code ?

## Introduction

- Master the **Principles**, **Practices**, and **Patterns**
- ***Principle***: A rule that helps you choose between potential solutions
- ***Practice***: A practice is a way of implementing something. Your should use principles to guide you in choosing the most appropriate practice for a given situation.
- ***Pattern***: A pattern is a potential solution to a problem. Each pattern is describe in a format that should help you evaluate its relevance for your problem.
- Using code to define and build infrastructure creates the opportunity to bring a wide set of tools, practices, and patterns to bear on the problem of designing and implementing systems.
- We want to build infrastructure that can continually evolve to meet changing requirements

 ### Infrastructure as Code
 - ***Infrastructure as Code*** is the practice of provisionig and managing infrastructure using code rather than command-line tools or ClickOps GUIs.
 - Infrastructure as Code is more than the mechanics of how infrastructure is defined and provisioned.
